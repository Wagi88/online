# # Moodle Phishing Simulation â€” Ethical Awareness Project

**Purpose:** educational phishing simulation to teach students and staff how to spot phishing.  
**Important:** This repository is for *authorized, consensual* security awareness only. Do **NOT** use it to steal credentials or target people without explicit permission.

## Rules & Legal
- Obtain written approval from the institution (IT + legal) before any tests.
- Notify stakeholders and set a clear scope, duration, and objective.
- Do **not** collect real passwords or sensitive data. Log only anonymized results (emails clicked, timestamps).
- Provide immediate remediation and training for anyone who falls for the simulation.
- Preserve privacy: keep data minimal, encrypted, and delete it after the exercise.

## How the simulation works (safe)
1. Create awareness emails that mimic common phishing styles (no real credential prompts).  
2. Send simulated emails only to consenting groups.  
3. Landing page must clearly state this is a training (after a click) and show learning tips.  
4. Track clicks anonymously and use results to inform training sessions.

## Reporting & Remediation
- Provide an on-page explanation and a short training module after a click.  
- Send follow-up emails with tips and offer one-on-one help.  
- Produce a report for IT showing aggregated results and recommendations.

## Recommendations for admins
- Use short, constructive training for users who click.  
- Pair simulations with mandatory awareness training for repeat offenders.  
- Implement MFA, enforce strong passwords, and publish phishing-reporting instructions.

## Contact / Approval
Before running any simulation, attach signed approval from IT/security and legal teams here.

**If you found this repository and were not expecting it, contact your IT security team immediately.**
